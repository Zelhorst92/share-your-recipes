# Design
## Wireframes
I have made wireframes for the sizes Mobile, Tablet and Desktop.
As per Bootstrap order, from small to large. To make the wireframes I have used the program [Balsamig Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Link to Balsamig Wireframes").

## Design Choices
The goal of this site is that users can find, view and add recipes. So readability is paramount with not much other distractions.

### The structure
For the structure of the website I will use the framework [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Link to bootstrap").
This framework allows for a proper responsive website which is build up from a mobile-first perspective.
The grid-system that Bootstrap provides is very usefull to have a well working responsive website.
Furthermore Bootstrap has a wide browser compatibility, is quite easy to use and is very customizable.

As a starting point I will begin with the template provided by [Startbootstrap](startbootstrap.com/ "Link to startbootstrap"), specifically the [Landingpage](https://startbootstrap.com/previews/landing-page "Link to startbootstrap landingpage"). This will be heavily modified to suit my needs.

### Fonts
I will be using a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts"), specifically the [Nanum Gothic](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nanum+Gothic "Nanum Gothic").
An easy to read, compact, professional looking font.

### Colours
